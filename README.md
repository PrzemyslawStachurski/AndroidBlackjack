## General info

This project was developed using Android Studio. Cards and deck are implemented using classes in Java. The activities are made using constraint, linear or drawer layout. It emulates a card game called "Blackjack". It allows you to modify your bet, hit and stand. At the end of the round you are notified about the result via alert dialog. Every possible result has its own corresponding dialog which shows your hand's value and compares it to the dealer's.
